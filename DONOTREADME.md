f*ck!!! I have been doing for almost two weeks(except weekends) and most importantly every single code is done by me. I wanted to finish this finish project in a week, but all these f**king bugs and teammates' undoing drag my expectation down.
P.S. please don't mind my saying. I just so angry and hungry since I have been debugging and performing experiments for almost 5 hours and all by myself!!!
